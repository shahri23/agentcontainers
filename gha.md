I want to write github action script to take a json file in repo folder and do a POST to grafana API to create a dashboard base don json file.

To create a GitHub Actions workflow that takes a JSON file from your repository and uses it to create a dashboard in Grafana via API, you can follow these general steps:

Set up Grafana API Key: Generate an API key in Grafana that has permissions to create dashboards. This can typically be done in Grafana under "Configuration" > "API Keys".

Store API Key as a Secret: Store the API key securely as a GitHub secret so that it can be used within your GitHub Actions workflow.

Write GitHub Actions Workflow: Create a workflow file (e.g., .github/workflows/create-dashboard.yml) in your repository to define the workflow steps.

Here's an example of what your workflow file might look like:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  create-dashboard:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Create Grafana Dashboard
        env:
          GRAFANA_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GRAFANA_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          curl -X POST \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer $GRAFANA_API_KEY" \
            -d @dashboard.json \
            https://your-grafana-instance/api/dashboards/db
```

Replace your-grafana-instance with the URL of your Grafana instance and dashboard.json with the path to
the JSON file in your repository containing the dashboard configuration.

JSON File Format: Ensure that the JSON file follows the format expected by the Grafana API for creating
dashboards. You can either manually create this JSON file or export an existing dashboard from Grafana to
use as a template.

Commit and Push: Commit the changes to your repository and push them to trigger the GitHub Actions
workflow.

Monitor Workflow: Monitor the workflow's execution in the "Actions" tab of your repository on GitHub. If there are any issues, check the workflow logs for error messages.

By following these steps, your GitHub Actions workflow should be able to create a Grafana dashboard using the JSON file stored in your repository. Make sure to handle errors and edge cases appropriately in your workflow script.
